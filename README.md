# Binary-Search-Tree
A binary search tree (BST) is a tree data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The key property of a BST is that the value of each node's left child is less than the value of the node itself, and the value of each node's right child is greater than the value of the node. This property allows for fast searching, insertion, and deletion operations, making BSTs useful for applications requiring efficient sorting and searching of data.

In this repo you will find my implementation of BST.

## Methods
- Insert(value)      [Insert new value in BST]
- Remove(value)      [Remove value from BST]
- find(value)        [Find a value in BST]
- getSmallest()      [Returns smallest value in BST]
- levelOrder()       [breadth-first tree traversal]
- inOrder()          [Inorder tree traversal]
- preOrder()         [Preorder tree traversal]
- postOrder()        [Postorder tree traversal]
- height()           [Returns the height of BST]
- depth(value)       [Returns the given node depth]
- isBalanced()       [Check BST balance: true/false]
- rebalance()        [Rebalances unbalanced BST]
